# dog_journal_app

Dog Journal is a simple Flutter app that lets users create and edit notes with a title, comment, and a photo from the gallery. All entries are stored locally using Hive. The app displays a list of saved notes, each showing a title and image preview.
It uses Flutter Bloc for state management and follows a clean, structured architecture with a minimalist, user-friendly interface.
